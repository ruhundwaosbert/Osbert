Media player, music - For this, I use a background service, and import MediaPlayer class, added an mp3 file to the raw folder from the res folder, access this file and was able to start the media play with a play button. The service assists by displaying a pause button once music starts playing, and removing the button when the stop button stops. It also senses when the user leaves the activity through the onPause() method, and called the unBindService method to pause the music.
